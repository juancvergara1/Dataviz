<h3>KPI Control Dashboard:</h3>
In this Power BI dashboard, stakeholders gain valuable insights into the team's performance through a comprehensive display of key performance indicators (KPIs). The KPIs are intelligently presented on a monthly basis, some of which are accompanied by specific goals. Behind the scenes, meticulous DAX coding was employed to seamlessly generate the visually appealing and informative charts and tables you see.To cater to the varying levels of experience within the team, a robust system of DAX tables and measures was meticulously crafted. These tables and measures take into account each team member's tenure in the project, allowing for dynamic goal setting. As the team's tenure evolves and more individuals gain experience, the goals automatically adjust to reflect their progress and proficiency.This dashboard empowers stakeholders to gain actionable insights into the team's performance, driving informed decision-making and facilitating targeted improvements.<br/>

<h3>Performance Grouping:</h3>
In this compelling Power BI dashboard, stakeholders are provided with a comprehensive view of the team's performance, categorized into different performance groups ranging from "Excellent" to "Outliers." This segmentation enables stakeholders to focus their attention on workers who are currently not meeting the goals for specific targets.Behind the scenes, advanced DAX techniques were utilized to create virtual tables, virtual variables, and other calculations that effectively group the workers into these performance categories. These powerful DAX constructs enable dynamic and accurate categorization of individuals based on their performance metrics.
By leveraging this dashboard, stakeholders can quickly identify and address performance gaps, allowing for targeted interventions and support for those who need it the most. This data-driven approach promotes a culture of continuous improvement and empowers stakeholders to optimize the team's overall performance.<br/>

<h3>Key Influencers:</h3>
This insightful Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive understanding of the interrelationships between variables. It allows stakeholders to visualize how specific drivers impact key performance indicators (KPIs) and contribute to their decrease. The visual was created using the powerful "Key Influencers" feature, which leverages machine learning techniques to identify patterns, associations, and even segments and groups within the data.By utilizing the Key Influencers visual, stakeholders gain a deep understanding of the direct impact that each driver has on the KPI they are focusing on. It enables them to uncover hidden insights, discover causal relationships, and make data-driven decisions based on the identified influencers.
This advanced visual empowers stakeholders to take targeted actions to optimize performance, address underlying issues, and maximize the desired outcomes. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the dashboard enhances the ability to extract valuable insights from the data, resulting in more informed decision-making and improved overall performance.
